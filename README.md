## Problem
Customer retention is a critical factor for sustainable growth in e-commerce. While industry leaders aim for a **retention rate of 85%**, our companyâ€™s performance has been consistently below this benchmark. Understanding the quarterly trend is essential to identify gaps and define actionable strategies.

## Data & Analysis
The retention rates across 2024 were as follows:

- **Q1:** 68.33%  
- **Q2:** 71.58%  
- **Q3:** 75.38%  
- **Q4:** 73.05%  

The **average retention rate** for the year was **72.08%**, which is **12.92 percentage points below the industry target of 85%**.

The analysis shows:
- A **positive trend** from Q1 to Q3, indicating improved customer loyalty.  
- A **slight dip in Q4**, signaling potential churn risks during the later part of the year.  
- Despite improvements, **retention consistently lags behind industry expectations**.

## Conclusion & Recommendation
While progress has been made, the company needs to **implement targeted retention campaigns** (such as loyalty programs, personalized offers, and proactive churn prevention measures) to close the gap with the industry standard and build long-term customer value.
